# Research for lm-function in R
Use data-tableB3.xlsx as dataset/n
Goal: Search for better adjusted R-square/n
I try many methods to preprocess data, including square, adjust weight according to Pr result in summary(lm), log, sigmoid, 1/exp, each column of data multiple with others...
I found that these method (including log, sigmoid, 1/exp) will increase adjusted R-square.
